##Memory Allocation Visualization
#Overview
The Memory Allocation Visualization project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize and simulate memory allocation algorithms, such as First-Fit, Best-Fit, and Worst-Fit. The application allows users to input memory requests and select the memory allocation strategy they wish to simulate, providing an interactive way to understand how these algorithms work.

#Features
Visual representation of memory blocks and their allocation status.
Simulates memory allocation using the First-Fit, Best-Fit, and Worst-Fit algorithms.
Ability to enter memory requests and allocate memory blocks dynamically.
Displays available memory blocks and allocated blocks in a color-coded manner (blue for free, green for allocated).

#Technologies Used
Java: The main programming language used for the application.
Swing: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit): Used for the graphical rendering of the memory blocks.
