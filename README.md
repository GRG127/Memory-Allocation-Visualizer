# Memory Allocation Visualization

## Overview

The **Memory Allocation Visualization** project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize and simulate memory allocation algorithms, such as **First-Fit**, **Best-Fit**, and **Worst-Fit**. The application allows users to input memory requests and select the memory allocation strategy they wish to simulate, providing an interactive way to understand how these algorithms work.

## Features
-  **Visual Representation**: Displays memory blocks with a color-coded system.
- **Simulates Algorithms**: First-Fit, Best-Fit, Worst-Fit.
-  **Dynamic Memory Request**: Input memory size and allocation strategy.



## Technologies Used
- ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-8-brightgreen) **Java**: The core programming language.
- ![Swing](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swing-Yes-blue) **Swing**: Used for creating the GUI.
